## Symlink Setup

Run `./setup.sh` or manually create:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` symlinked to `global/CLAUDE.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/` symlinked to `agents/skills/`
- `~/.claude/settings.json` symlinked to `global/settings.json`

## Sandboxing Defaults

This starter ships with conservative permission defaults in `global/settings.json` (symlinked to `~/.claude/settings.json` by `setup.sh`). The model: allow reads, block destructive operations, prompt for everything in between. See `global/PERMISSIONS.md` for the full explanation and customization guide.

## Working With Skills

Skills follow the Claude Code SKILL.md format. See `/write-skill` for the authoring guide.

### Least-Privilege Tool Access

Skills should declare only the tools they need in `allowed-tools`. A read-only research skill should not have write access. A reporting skill should not have message-send access. Narrow tool access limits the blast radius when a skill misbehaves.

### Dynamic Context Rules (Critical)

- No `$()` in dynamic context (blocked by Claude Code security)
- No `||` or `&&` in dynamic context (permission system blocks these)
- Always use `2>/dev/null | head -N` to suppress errors and neutralize exit codes
- Use `origin/HEAD` instead of hardcoding branch names
- Keep output bounded with `| head -N`

### Testing Skills

After editing a skill, test it by running the `/skill-name` command in any project. Skills are loaded from the symlinked directory so changes are immediately available.

## Conventions

- Keep skills concise and imperative
- Use numbered steps for predictable execution
- Include abort conditions and loop limits
- No backticks in prose (shell evaluation breaks them)
- No contractions (single-quote interpretation issues)
